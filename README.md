# Inventory Application

## Summary
This was a project that I created to keep track of inventory at a bar. This idea was inspired by
a friend who was recording their inventory additions and removals on a google sheet. I created this application
to allow a business to log the quantity of their merchandise, and the removal and addition of these 
items. Upon any user action, a POST request is sent to the database to record the user's name and activity.

## Getting Started
npm run dev or
yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technology Used
React.js, Next.js, Typescript, Ant Design, MongoDB Atlas, and Mongoose
